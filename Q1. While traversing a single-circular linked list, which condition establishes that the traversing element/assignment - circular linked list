Q1. While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition
establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first
element?
Ans1. For traversing through the linked list we stop the traversal when we
reach the first node again. Hence the condition imposed is “temp ==
self.head” .If the condition is True the loop breaks.


def printList(self):
  temp = self.head
  if self.head is not None :
    while(True)
      print(temp.data, end=" ")
      temp = temp.next
      if (temp == self.head):
        break
  
  
  Q2. What are the practical applications of a circular linked list?
Ans2.
1. Keeping track of which player’s turn it is in a multiplayer board game
or a normal game.
2. Audio or video streaming on the device (playlist of song or video starts
again from the first song after the last song is finished playing.
3. The forward and back button in the browser of the PC.
4. Maintaining a directory of names.
5. Undo function in photoshop or word or any photo/document software
6. Performing arithmetic operations on long integers.
